# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict residential property prices using machine learning techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset includes structural attributes, location-based scores, amenities, and proximity features that influence housing value.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key drivers of housing prices
- Engineer meaningful features for modeling
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict house prices
- Visualize insights and model results in a clear, reproducible way

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following variables:

- `Square_Feet`: Total living area in square meters
- `Num_Bedrooms`, `Num_Bathrooms`, `Num_Floors`: Structural attributes
- `Year_Built`: Year the house was built
- `Has_Garden`, `Has_Pool`: Binary features indicating amenities
- `Garage_Size`: Size of the garage
- `Location_Score`: Composite score representing quality of location
- `Distance_to_Center`: Distance to the city center (in km)
- `Price`: Target variable (house price in currency units)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (3.10+)
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (regression models and preprocessing)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

The project tests multiple regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (optional)

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
